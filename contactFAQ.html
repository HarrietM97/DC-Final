<!-- Classes questions -->


<button class="accordion">CLASSES</button>
<div class="panel">

  <button class="accordion">What kind of classes do you offer?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We offer weekly classes in Ballet, Contemporary, Hip Hop, Jazz, Lyrical and Contemporary Fusion! If you want to audition for the Student-led Dance Show pieces you can enjoy a variety of different styles such as Bollywood or Irish Dancing
</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I thought LSE offered Salsa and Swing classes. Why aren’t those on the timetable?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>LSE does offer Salsa and Swing classes! If you’re interested in either of these styles there are separate societies dedicated to them both. Find the Salsa Society at https://www.lsesu.com/organisation/7246/ and the Swing Society at https://www.facebook.com/LSESwing/?ref=br_rs </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I heard Dance Club has a Tap team? Since there’s no tap class on the timetable, where is it?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>As we do not have the facilities to run a Tap class on campus, we have a Tap competition team this year which any one can audition for and our Tap representative will organize going to tap classes together that will be subsidised by us!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What do I wear to class?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Make sure to wear something you can move in but other than that just wear anything you find comfortable! If you own specific shoes for certain classes, like Ballet, it’s best to bring those along, other than that you can just wear normal trainers for Hip Hop and Commercial or go in bare feet for any classes (Don’t worry this is normal!)</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do I need tap or pointe shoes?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Tap shoes are necessary if you are going to be competing in our competition team. Pointe is not taught in our classes, however, if you want to choreograph a pointe piece for the dance show or talk to your teacher about a possible pointe class please do!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do I have to attend the class every week?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>In Michaelmas Term as we are not preparing for the Dance Show you will not have to attend class every week. However, attendance will be taken and will be considered for acceptance into the teacher’s show piece in Lent Term in the event of over-enrollment.
 If you are in a competition team you will need to attend every rehearsal unless you have a valid reason for not being able to.
In Lent Term we will expect you to attend at least 80% of the rehearsals of any show piece you decide to commit to, as it is very hard for our teachers if students miss choreography and spacing. It’s always best to be there so you never feel you’ve missed out! If you do have to miss a class in this case and do start feeling like you’re falling behind please speak to your Genre Rep who will be happy to help!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">So I can just come to one class if I want to?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes, if you only want to attend one class then you can pay £6 as a non-member, however, after the 2nd week of Lent Term this will not be possible as we will be preparing for the Dance Show.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Are there any classes after the Dance Show?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We don’t hold any classes the week after the Dance Show to give all our dancers a well-deserved rest! We do hold dance free classes for members throughout the Easter break on an ad-hoc basis so whenever you need a break from studying, we have your back.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I'm a complete beginner but there's no beginners class, can I still go?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Any class that doesn't specify a level will be open for all to attend. The teacher will teach at a general level but they’re always happy to slow down and answer any questions you have if it all gets a bit too much! We pride ourselves on having a very welcoming atmosphere in all our classes so please don’t worry.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I’m not sure whether to go to beginners or advanced class. What should I do?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>All our level specific classes are taught back to back so you can always have a go at both if you're not sure or if you’d rather just watch the class you can do that too. (We recommend trying out the class first as it can always look a lot more daunting than it really is!)</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I saw that you film videos of every class. Where do the videos go and why do you do this?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We film our classes every week to allow our members to watch the videos and study how they can improve and the things they did well. It’s a great way to commemorate the learning process and looking back on your growth and the end of the year is so rewarding! We will upload the videos to our Dance Club Google Drive. Nevertheless, if you don’t want to be recorded, do let the class rep know.</p>

<!-- Shows and Competitions questions -->

  <button class="accordion">SHOWS AND COMPETITIONS</button>
  <div class="panel">

  <button class="accordion">How many shows does LSE Dance Club perform a year?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We hold our Annual Dance Show every March in the Peacock Theatre, as well as a smaller charity show in the Michaelmas Term. We also perform at events with other societies throughout the year so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">How can I take part in shows?
</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>You can choreograph, dance or even run for a position on the Show Committee! Show Committee elections will be held towards the end of Michaelmas Term.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What are Choreographer auditions?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>To be able to be a choreographer in our Annual Dance Show you will need to fill in a form to indicate your interest at the end of Michaelmas Term. You may also apply as a group of choreographers or choreograph more than one piece. You will then need to choreograph approximately 30 seconds and audition in front of our show committee. Every year we have a theme for the dance show which we will expect you to follow and explain how your piece relates to the theme. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What are Dancer auditions?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>To be able to compete in a student led piece you will have to attend an audition the first weekend of Lent Term. More information will be released over the winter break.
</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do I have to audition to be in every piece?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>No! Our weekly classes led by our teachers allow our members to take part in Dance Show pieces audition-free. Just make sure you attend the weekly classes and you will be in the piece.
In the event of over-enrollment in our teacher-led pieces, members with regular attendance in Michaelmas Term will be given priority to be part of the piece.
</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I'm not part of LSE, can I perform in the shows?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If you’re a member of the club and have auditioned for a place or take classes every week then you can be in the show!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Is there a deadline for being able to take part in the show?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Unfortunately, we can’t allow people to take part in a piece if they have missed the first 3 classes of Lent term or if you miss over 3 classes once the choreography for the show has started. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">When are the auditions for the competitions?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The auditions to be on the competition teams will be held Week 1 and Week 2 of Michaelmas Term. More updates will be posted on this Page and our Group.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I'm unable to attend an audition...what can I do?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If you are unable to attend the audition slot for a style you are interested in please notify the person conducting the audition as soon as you can to let them know.
In the case of Competition team auditions, there is a possibility of being assessed by the choreographer at Dance Day on the 30th September instead. In this case, please let the choreographer know who you are at the beginning of the class. Other options will be up to the choreographer and include, but are not limited to, being asked to see you in the genres class, organising a time for you both to meet or sending them a video of your past dance experience.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Why don’t we take part in *insert University Dance Competition name here*?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If we’re not taking part in a certain University Dance Competition it is most likely because the event would clash with other events we have planned! For example, Loughborough takes place the weekend before our Dance Show and unfortunately, many others take place around this time. If there’s a competition you know about that you would like us to take part in, do speak to any of the committee members or genre/ class reps.</p>
